You are given a string that consists of characters and a paired number of quotation marks. You need to return an Iterable consisting
of the texts inside the quotation marks. But choose only quotes with double quotation marks ("). Single quotation marks (') arenâ€™t
appropriate.

Input: A string.

Output: An iterable.

Example:

findQuotes('"Greetings"') == ['Greetings']
findQuotes('Hi') == []
