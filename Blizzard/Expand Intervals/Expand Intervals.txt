An interval of consecutive positive integers can be succinctly described as an array that contains first and last values. 
For example, the interval that contains the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 can be described as [5,9]. Multiple intervals can be united 
together into array. Given an array with intervals (guaranteed not to overlap with each other and to be listed in sorted ascending
order), create and return the list that contains all the integers contained by these intervals.

Input: Array of array of two integers.

Output: Array of integers.

Example:

expandIntervals([[1, 3], [5, 7]]) == [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
expandIntervals([[1, 3]]) == [1, 2, 3]
